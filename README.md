# Portfolio

This is a portfolio site that mimic Windows interface (but a simpler version) 😂  
And Slack application (Also a simpler version) 

Inspired by [Vscode Portfolio by Itsnitinr](https://github.com/itsnitinr/vscode-portfolio)  
⬆ You should totally check it out. It's so cool compared to mine!

## Features
- Navigate between different routes/pages in Slack app 🔃
- Easily CRUD projects and channels by editing data/index.json ✏
- Submit form without any backend code (Using [Netlify Form](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/)) 😉

## Note (s)
### If you are using React + Netlify Form without Server Side Rendering (SSR)  
Refer [this](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/07/20/how-to-integrate-netlifys-form-handling-in-a-react-app/)  
I used the second method which is via Fetch API to implement the feature 😀

## Interesting packages used
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started)
- [React Particles JS](https://github.com/Wufe/react-particles-js)
- [React Slick](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick)
