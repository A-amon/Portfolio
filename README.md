# Portfolio

This is a portfolio site that mimic Windows interface (but a simpler version) üòÇ  
And Slack application (Also a simpler version)  

**Warning:** Best view in desktop size as Slack app/modal is not responsive

Inspired by [Vscode Portfolio by Itsnitinr](https://github.com/itsnitinr/vscode-portfolio)  
‚¨Ü You should totally check it out. It's so cool compared to mine!

## Features
- Navigate between different routes/pages in Slack app üîÉ
- Easily CRUD projects and channels by editing [data/index.json](https://github.com/A-amon/Portfolio/blob/dev/src/data/index.json) ‚úè
- Submit form without any backend code (Using [Netlify Form](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/)) üòâ

## Note (s)
### If you are using React + Netlify Form without Server Side Rendering (SSR)  
Refer [this](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/07/20/how-to-integrate-netlifys-form-handling-in-a-react-app/)  
I used the second method which is via Fetch API to implement the feature üòÄ

## How to use üéâüéâ
**Note:** Please do not claim this code as yours. Credit me when used üòÄ
### Adding pin
|key|description|
|---|-----------|
|control|Id of modal component (Has to be same as component's name)|
### Adding workspace
Currently, adding new workspace won't allow you to navigate to the new workspace. üòÖ

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
